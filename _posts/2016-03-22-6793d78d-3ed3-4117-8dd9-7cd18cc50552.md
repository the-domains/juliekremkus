Project: In-House Publication  
Client: Tawazen Interior Design  
Role: Art Direction | Design

The commission was to create and publish a "coffee table" book of Tawazen's current portfolio for distribution to potential clients in the UAE and the surrounding territories. The lavish design takes inspiration from the firm's Middle Eastern culture and design philosophy.

The cover and slipcase is white ostrich bound and embossed. The interior divides into three sections based on the firm's colors, each representing categories of focus (orange = office, brown = commercial, silver = residential). All pages, except end papers and a vellum first page, are French folded. Patterns are printed on the inside of the fold, generated from the design of the corresponding project.
