CO Architects' website
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cff3ad53-2239-4f8a-942c-a6145aa03884.jpg)

Project: Website Design  
Client: CO Architects  
Role: Creative Direction | Design | Development

It was essential that we clearly represented CO Architect's extensive portfolio of large and complex architectural projects, the site be exceedingly user-friendly and a go-to destination for information sharing in the firm's professional community.

An extension of CO Architect's existing brand identity, the design is based on a hierarchy of image rich, visually focused content while using an adaptive approach to ensure the site is fast loading and optimized for numerous screen sizes.
